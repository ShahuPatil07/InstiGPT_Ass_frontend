### Journey of the assignment
* This is a part of assignment given by AI community for the recruitments of their project 'InstiGPT'. The moment this assignment was given, i was done with Basic frontend (Advanced JS) but had no idea how things work in a React App. First 3-4 days I spent learning React (was kind of a crash course). I already has idea how things work in a note keeper app. So just did the whole thing in React instead of pure HTML, CSS, JS.   After this project I realised I can have great proficiency in Frontend tasks.
